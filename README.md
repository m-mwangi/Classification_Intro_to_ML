# **Maternal Health Risk Prediction (Matern_AI)**  

##  Introduction  
This project aims to develop and compare a vanilla Neural Network model to a model incorporating optimization techniques as well as Classical Algorithms to predict maternal health risk among pregnant women as either low, mid, or high risk.

##  About the Dataset  
The dataset used for this model is publicly available on Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [Maternal Health Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/maternal-health-risk-data/data)  

### **Key Vairables:**  
- **Age** - This is age in years when a woman is pregnant. 
- **SystolicBP** - The upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg.
- **DiastolicBP** - Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg.
- **BS (Blood Sugar Level)** - Blood glucose levels in terms of molar concentration, mmol/L.  
- **HeartRate** - A normal resting heart rate in beats per minute.
- **Risk Level** - Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy considering the previous attributes. Categorized as either 'High Risk', 'Low Risk', or 'Mid Risk'.

##  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
 **Handling Missing and Duplicate Data**  
   - No missing values were found in the dataset.  
   - 562 duplicate rows were identified and removed to enhance model accuracy.  

 **Outlier Detection & Correction**  
   - An unrealistic HeartRate value of 7 was detected and replaced with the mode (70 bpm).  

 **Encoding Categorical Variables**  
   - The Risk Level variable was encoded as follows:  
     - `2` â†’ High Risk  
     - `1` â†’ Mid Risk  
     - `0` â†’ Low Risk  

 **Feature Correlation Analysis**  
   - A correlation heatmap revealed that Blood Sugar (BS) had the strongest positive correlation with Risk Level (0.55).  
   - Age and HeartRate showed weaker correlations but were retained as features.  

 **Handling Class Imbalance**  
   - **Class distribution after dropping duplicate rows:**  
     - 234 Low-Risk cases  
     - 106 Mid-Risk cases  
     - 112 High-Risk cases  
   - The imbalance was addressed through data scaling and appropriate model selection.  

 **Data Splitting & Scaling**  
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets.  
   - Feature values were scaled for improved model performance.
